# Efficient-portfolios-and-estimation-uncertainty
The goal of this exercise is to 1) Find the standard (Markowitz) efficient porfolio 2) Show how estimation uncertainty can impact optimal portfolio weights.  The exercise is coded in R using mostly packages within the tidyverse.

Efficient Portfolios and Estimation Uncertainty:
Script loads data (For this exercise I use a Portfolio of 10 Industries that can be found on Kenneth French's website (https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html)), computes sample mean and Covariance matrix, as well as Sharpe Ratios for all the portfolios.
